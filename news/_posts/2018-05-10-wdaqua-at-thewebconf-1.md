title: WDAqua@The Web Conference 2018 - Part 1
summary: The Web Conference 2018 took place from 23 to 27 April 2018. It was a massive event and WDAqua was present in various forms, of which we write in this post (part 1).
---
The Web Conference took place from the 23rd to the 27th of April  in Lyon. It was a massive event, with more than 2000 attendees, 1172 paper submissions to the research track, 27 workshops, 30 demos, and more.

The conference was very competitive: the acceptance rate in the research track was 15% (A+ rated). WDAqua had a strong presence, with 1 full paper presentation, 2 workshop papers, and 1 workshop jointly organised by some of the members of our consortium.

Data search was one of the main topics at the conference. [Natasha Noy](https://ai.google/research/people/NatalyaNoy) from Google pointed out the importance of understanding how users search for data and how to detect data-related queries, during her keynote at the [SAVE-SD workshop](https://save-sd.github.io/2018/index.html). 
This was also one of the topics of the [PROFILE & DATA:SEARCH workshop](https://profiles-datasearch.github.io/2018/), organised by our [Laura Koesten](http://wdaqua.eu/students/laura-koesten/), [Elena Demidova](https://demidova.wordpress.com/), [Stefan Dietze](https://stefandietze.wordpress.com), and [Elena Simperl](http://wdaqua.eu/supervisors/elena-simperl/), plus [Vadim Savenkov](https://www.wu.ac.at/infobiz/team/vadim-savenkov), [John Breslin](http://www.nuigalway.ie/our-research/people/engineering-and-informatics/johnbreslin/), and [Oscar Corcho](http://mayor2.dia.fi.upm.es/oeg-upm/index.php/en/teachers/11-ocorcho/). The workshop aimed to look at different aspects of data search and retrieval on the Web, bringing together researchers and practitioners from different disciplines, such as information retrieval, the semantic web, and human-computer interaction.
The two keynotes hosted by the workshop reflected this diversity of perspectives. [Maarten de Rijke](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/m.derijke/), from the University of Amsterdam, presented the work done by his team to develop optimal algorithms for data search and retrieval. On the other hand, [Aidan Hogan](http://aidanhogan.com/) talked about the use of graphs in data search and the importance of profiling to make these usable.

The workshop included a paper presentation from one WDAqua student, [Emilia Kacprzak](http://wdaqua.eu/students/emilia-kacprzak/). Her work focused on understanding how people write queries to look for data and what is important in data requests. The paper can be found [here](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3191597).

The panel, formed by [Paul Groth](http://pgroth.com/), [Aidan Hogan](http://aidanhogan.com), [Jeni Tennison](https://www.jenitennison.com), [Stefan Dietze](https://stefandietze.wordpress.com/) and [Natasha Noy](https://research.google.com/pubs/NatalyaNoy.html)), revolved around the question “do we need a Google for data?”.

The answers were quite nuanced: although the participants agreed with the need to have powerful search instruments for data, they highlighted various points, such as valuing the importance of using currently existing tools [check] and of having domain-specific tools.

For those who missed it at The Web Conference, a new edition of the DATA:SEARCH workshop has been already planned for SIGIR’18.

Members of WDAqua took part also in other workshops. [Elena Simperl](http://wdaqua.eu/supervisors/elena-simperl/) was one of the keynote speakers at the [HUML workshop](https://humlworkshop.github.io/HumL-WWW2018/). She presented the work done with her supervisees [Alessandro Piscopo](http://wdaqua.eu/students/alessandro-piscopo/) and [Lucie Kaffee](http://wdaqua.eu/students/lucie-aim%C3%A9e-kaffee/) about Wikidata’s social fabric and the effect of human and automated contributions on its data quality.

Last but not least, [Lucie](http://wdaqua.eu/students/lucie-aim%C3%A9e-kaffee/) presented her poster at the Wiki Workshop. In her study, she shed light about the stability of human-readable labels of Wikidata over time.
