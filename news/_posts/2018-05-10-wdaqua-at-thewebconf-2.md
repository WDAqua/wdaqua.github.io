After the first two days of workshops, the main conference tracks started on the 25th of April and with these the plenary sessions and keynotes. Speakers and panel members were top level and covered key topics around the Web and Artificial Intelligence. 
How to deal with extremism and polluting agents in general on the Web, and whether enforcing some sort of control would be a good strategy against that were among the questions raised during the compelling keynote of [Luciano Floridi](https://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/people/luciano-floridi/), of the University of Oxford. Find the video of his talk [here](http://thewebconf.webcastor.tv/media/video/22).

On the second day of the main conference, [Kuldeep Singh](http://wdaqua.eu/students/kuldeep-singh/) presented his paper “Why Reinvent the Wheel: Let's Build Question Answering Systems Together”.

This is the outcome of Kuldeep’s and other WDAqua members’ work and addresses the question of how to flexibly integrate different components in a Question-Answering pipeline, in order to optimise its performance. The answer to that is an approach that uses machine learning to select the best performing components for the input questions. This approach is implemented in Frankenstein, a QA framework able to select QA components and compose QA pipelines. We knew Frankenstein could infuse life into creatures, but apparently from now on it can contribute to (Artificial) Intelligence!
