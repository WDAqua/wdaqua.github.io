title: Meet our Early Stage Researchers
summary: A new series of interviews to get to know our ESRs.
---

WDAqua includes 15 Early Stage Researchers from all over the world, based in 6 institutions across Europe.
They have all different motivations and backgrounds, but work together in WDAqua to advance the state of the art of Question-Answering systems over Web data under various points of view.

We interviewed them to have a chance to get to know them more personally, to present the outcomes of their research, and to have a glimpse of the life of Marie Curie ITN ESRs.

The first interview of this series has been conducted with [Dennis Diefenbach](http://wdaqua.eu/students/dennis-diefenbach/).
