We are proud to announce that we have just created the official YouTube channel of WDAqua. We will use it to host content produced by our participants, in which they can present themselves and their research outcomes in an accessible way.
You can find the link [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9QJUccHsphERHGi8HAbQRQ).

The first content we will upload will be a series of interviews from our ESRs, so check the channel if you want to know them better. We are looking forward to receiving your feedback!
